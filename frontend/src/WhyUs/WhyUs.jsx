            <p>The main goal of this website is to create a simple web application that
provides great user experience with responsiveness (i.e., mobile friendly) and high
performance. Apart from helping travelers find their fellow travelers and connecting
them, the application will also act as a travel guide with a lot of high-quality information,
tips, and suggestions about highlights at a given place and time.</p>
            <p>The application primarily focuses on users who love to travel but are held back due to
incompatible schedule with friends or family. The platform allows users to quickly search
for amazing destinations and group up with other travelers to visit that destination. Also,
users can explore several activities and highlights at the destination like biking trails,
ferry rides, fishing, photography, local food, nightlife etc.</p>
<p>The platform can be made as the go-to application for people when they decide to plan a
getaway from their routine, without having to keep thinking about othersâ€™ schedules
which in most cases results in deferring or cancelling the vacation plan. If a person
decides to take a vacation, they can hit up the app and get their backpack ready for the
getaway! Need not waste the time and opportunity by depending on other people with a
different schedule.</p></div>
